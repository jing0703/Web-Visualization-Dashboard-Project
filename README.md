# Web-Visualization-Dashboard-Project

Data is more powerful when we share it with others! Let's take what we've learned about HTML and CSS to create a dashboard showing off the analysis we've done.

Use a different dataset! The requirements above still hold, but make it your own.
Use a bootstrap theme to customize your website. You may use a tool like Bootswatch. Make it look snazzy, give it some attitude. If using this, be sure you also meet all of the requirements listed above.
Add extra visualizations! The more comparisons the better, right?
Use meaningful glyphicons next to links in the header.
Have visualization navigation on every visualizations page with an active state. See the screenshots below.
